# Welcome

Hi, 

Buckle up, because you're about to fall of you chair. 

I am proud delighted and chuffed to bits to announce the release of the much anticipated **pomodorUp**! This delightful menu bar app is a ground-breaking and radical innovation at the cutting edge of productivity science: a timer. 


That counts Up, instead of down.


When you've recovered, feel free to try it out. It's free. 


The premise is that a pomodoro timer should tell you the minimum time to stay focused, not interrupt you while you are. This does exactly that, in *style*.

I hope you enjoy it.



### Roadmap:

- Tweak the look a bit.
- Reset the timer when computer goes to sleep
- Make a starting timer animation.
- Add sounds
- Change the way the custom target time is set.
- Fix the menu so the elapsed time item gets updated live.
